Current Development Status
Pocket Tourney is still in development, and there are several nuts and bolts to be ironed out. The game is being developed by a one-man team with literally no budget, which presents unique challenges and opportunities.

Key Areas in Development
Gameplay Mechanics: We are continuously refining the gameplay mechanics to ensure an engaging and dynamic experience. Ensuring pucks do not overlap borders and enhancing the AI are top priorities.

ToN Integration: The integration of in-game assets as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is in progress. This will empower players with true ownership, allowing them to trade and leverage these assets beyond the game.

PlayDeck Launch: The launch on the PlayDeck platform is being developed to provide a seamless and rewarding experience. This includes the play-to-earn model where players can earn cryptocurrency for their successes in tournaments.
